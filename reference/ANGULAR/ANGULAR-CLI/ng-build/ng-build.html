    ***************** production build ********************
    1. after current build result files will be in 'dist' folder.
    2. 'ng build --prod' for old Angular versions.
    3. 'ng build --configuration production' for new Angular versions.
    4. current build will optimize our code for production.
    5. this build use AOT compilation ,which means it will already pass
       all the angular templates and turn them into 'vanilla JS'.
    6. 'dist' forlder will be created. This content will be uploaded to server.
    7. By default, the ng build command uses the production configuration
       so this is default: 'ng build --configuration=production' and 
       you can use just 'ng build'.
    8. you need update base from index.html with CLI when you upload files to production.
